# WritBit

WritBit is a free writing software that I created partly as a programming exercise for myself and a way for me to get features that I’ve always wanted when writing short stories or novels. I’ve always been a fan of the Q10 writing program and I’ve used it as a template for WritBit with some familiar and additional features.

 * A full-screen “distraction free” text editor with minimal features so authors can completely focus on the writing process with as little distractions as possible.

 * A customizable writing space including colors, font and margins.

 * An expanded note taking system accessed within the app. You can store notes and tag them individually to make searching for specific ideas easier in your research or while    you’re writing. 

* Instant synonym look up while writing using the powerful Datamuse API (used by websites such as OneLook).

* Lookup words by meaning, topic or antonyms by searching inside the app. 

## Planned Features

* Add support for images in the notes system. 

* Instant Wikipedia search inside the app using a built-in browser. 

* Color-code selected words. 

* Find & Replace.

* Autosave and timers.

* Word count for highlighted text.

* Custom “book-view”.
